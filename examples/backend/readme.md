- Make a folder

```sh
mkdir backend && cd backend
npm init
```

- Create index.js file with below content:

```sh
echo "console.log('hello world')" > index.js
```

- Add script to package.json:

```json
"start": "node index.js"
```

- We can run the program directly:

```sh
node index.js
```

- Or we can run it as:

```sh
npm start
```

## Simple Web Server

Let's change the app into a web server:

```js
const http = require("http") // Node's built-in web server module

const app = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" })
  res.end("Hello World")
})

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT)
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
```

- run **`npm start`** to start the server & visit http://localhost:3001
- The address http://localhost:3001/foo/bar will display the same content.

To serve raw data in the JSON format to the frontend we can do this:

```js
const http = require("http")

let notes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    content: "HTML is easy",
    date: "2019-05-30T17:30:31.098Z",
    important: false,
  },
  ...
]

const app = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" })
  res.end(JSON.stringify(notes))
})

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT)
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
```

## Expess

**Express** is an interface to work with built-in **http** module. It provides a better abstraction for general use cases we usually require to build a backend server.

```sh
npm install express
```

- To update the dependencies of our project we can:

```sh
npm update
```

## Web and Express

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

let notes = [
  ...
]

app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.send('<h1>Hello World!</h1>')
})

app.get('/api/notes', (request, response) => {
  response.json(notes)
})

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

We define two *routes* to the app. The event handler function accepts two parameters: **`request`** and **`response`**. **`request`** contains all of the info of the HTTP request, **`response`** parameters is used to define how the request is responded to.

The request to the app's root (**`/`**) is answered by using the **`send`** method of the **`response`** object. Server responds with the string **`<h1>Hello World!</h1>`**, that was passed to the **`send`** method. Since the parameter is a string, express automatically sets the value of the **`Content-Type`** header to be **`text/html`**. The status code of the response defaults to **`200`**.

The second route defines an event handler, that handles **HTTP GET** request made to the **_notes_** path of the application.

The request is responded to with the **`json`** method of the **`response`** object. **`Content-Type`** is automatically set to **`application/json`**.

In the earlier version where we were only using Node, we had to transform the data into the JSON format with the **`JSON.stringify`** method.

```js
response.end(JSON.stringify(notes))
```

With Express, this transformation happens automatically.

## Nodemon

> nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will autumatically restart your node application.

```sh
# npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

We can start our application with **_nodemon_** like this:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js
```

Even though the backend server restarts automatically, the browser still has to be manually refreshed.

Let's define a dedicated **_npm script_** for it in the **_package.json_** file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js",
}
```

Start the server in the dev mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## REST

Singular things, like notes, persons, tasks, are called **_resources_** in RESTful thinking. Every resource has an associated URL, which is the resource's unique address.

One convention is to create the unique address for the resources by combining the name of the resource type with the resource's unique identifier.

If the root URL of our service is **_www.example.com/api_** & we define the resource type of notes to be **_note_**, then the address of a note resource with the identifier 10, has the unique address **_www.example.com/api/notes/10_**.

The URL for the entire collection of note resources is **_www.example.com/api/notes_**.

We can execute different operations on resources. The operation to be executed is defined by the HTTP verb:


| URL            | Verb         | Functionality                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`notes/10`** | **`GET`**    | fetches a single resource                                        |
| **`notes`**    | **`GET`**    | fetches all resources in the collection                          |
| **`notes`**    | **`POST`**   | creates a new resource based on the request data                 |
| **`notes/10`** | **`DELETE`** | removes the identified resource                                  |
| **`notes/10`** | **`PUT`**    | replaces the entire identified resource with the request data    |
| **`notes/10`** | **`PATCH`**  | replaces a part of the identified resource with the request data |
